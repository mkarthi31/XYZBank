2. Loan Record Management
Customers can apply for a new loan if they meet the eligibility criteria:
The total loan amount left to pay across all their loans must not exceed four times their annual income.

Record ID (unique six-digit number, e.g., 123456).
Loan Type (one of: "Auto", "Builder", "Mortgage", "Personal", or "Other").
